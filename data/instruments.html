            encounter a wall, another rover, or an obstacle. When a rover encounters a wall, it emits a midi note
            corresponding to the row and column, then reverses direction. When a rover encounters another rover, both
            rovers are rotated clockwise. When a rover encounters an obstacle, the effects of the obstacle are applied
            to the rover which could alter its position, its direction, both, or neither depending on the type of
            obstacle.</p>
